# PR Verification Checklist

Automated checks are necessary but not sufficient. This checklist is what a PR
author runs before requesting review. Record the evidence in the PR body so a
reviewer can see what was verified, on which setup. Skip a section only when it
does not apply, and say so explicitly.

## Automated gates

Run all four from the repository root; all must pass (mirrors `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s
"Before Submitting a PR"):

```bash
npm run lint        # biome
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run test        # vitest, including the *-e2e.test.ts suites
npm run build       # tsc
```

`npm run lint:fix` auto-fixes most style issues. If the change touches the
end-to-end surface, also run the scripted suite directly:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

`PI_E2E_LIVE=1 npm run test:e2e` swaps the scripted faux suite for the live one
and exercises a real model through your local `pi` login (`PI_PROVIDER` /
`PI_MODEL` can pin the provider and model). Run it by hand before publishing.

## Manual TUI checks

Run these in a live pi session with the extension installed from the branch, and
note the pi version in the PR body. Renderer behavior differs across pi
versions; when the change targets a newer runtime, verify on that version too.

- Exercise the changed surface end to end in a real session — spawn, steer,
  render, resume, or whatever the PR touches.
- Toggle collapsed/expanded states with ctrl+o and, on pi 0.87.1+, per-row
  click; confirm both paths reach the same state and the marker and hint update.
- Check theme and color rendering in at least one dark theme; confirm wrapped or
  clipped text stays within the intended box.
- Feed long and edge inputs (empty, whitespace-only, multi-line, large) and
  confirm the collapsed row stays bounded while the expanded view shows the full
  content.
- Confirm terminal control characters (ESC/OSC/CSI, newlines, tabs) in untrusted
  text cannot forge rows or leak into the terminal: display copies are
  sanitized, model-facing payloads are not.

## Session-level checks

Run these when the change touches session data, rendering, or persistence:

- Load and replay an existing session containing the affected entry or tool
  call; the old data must render without throwing.
- Run `/export` and confirm the HTML renders without a crash and the affected
  content appears where expected.
- If the change touches cross-extension RPC or events, verify the RPC surface
  still answers.

## Fork release rules

- Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` on non-release branches; the fork's
  `validate-package-version` CI gate rejects it.
- Release notes go in the PR body under `## Release notes`, with attribution
  where one applies.

## Evidence

In the PR body, record:

- the pi version and platform used for the live checks;
- each command you ran and its result;
- the manual observations (what you saw, not just "works");
- any check that does not apply, and why.
